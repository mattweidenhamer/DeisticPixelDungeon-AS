I made this on a whim as a kid, when I was deeply ingrained in the Pixel Dungeon modding community (and I'm very thankful for it, since it taught me a lot about programming in a more advanced system). Now I'm just about to be graduating college. In case there's any more doubt, I no longer have the ability to maintain this project. If you would like to adopt this and make it as grand as it could be, you have my blessing :)
